# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


*  Firebase Authentication Integration:Get auth

It imports Firebase Authentication methods and initializes Firebase with the app configuration.
It sets up a getAuth instance to interact with Firebase Authentication.

+ Authentication State Management:UseState of loading

The component manages the user's authentication state using the useState hook. The user state variable holds the current authenticated user, and the loading state variable is used to track loading states.


- useEffect for Authentication State Changes:

It uses the useEffect hook to listen for changes in the user's authentication state using onAuthStateChanged. When the authentication state changes, it updates the user state variable accordingly.


+ Import Dependencies:

It imports necessary dependencies from React, including useContext for accessing the authentication context and useLocation for obtaining the current location.


* Access Authentication Context:

+ It uses the useContext hook to access the authentication context (AuthContext) created earlier. This allows the component to retrieve information about the authenticated user and the loading state.
- Authentication Context:

You are using the AuthContext to access authentication-related functionality, such as signing in and signing in with Google.
- Sign In Form:

The component renders a sign-in form that includes fields for email and password.
It uses the handleSignIn function to handle form submission.
The email and password values are retrieved from the form input fields.
- Google Sign-In:

There is a "Google" button that allows users to sign in using their Google account. This is achieved through the handleGoogle function, which calls the googleSignIn function from the AuthContext.
Upon successful sign-in, the user is redirected to the previous page or the home page.
Form Validation:

The code includes basic client-side form validation for the password field. It checks if the password meets a specific pattern (at least 8 characters with letters and numbers).
If the password doesn't meet the pattern, a warning message is displayed using swal (presumably a library like SweetAlert).
Server Interaction:

After a successful sign-in, the user's email is extracted from the form data.
+ A PATCH request is made to the server at https://khan-m5rxu3e0t-khans-projects-8df7d1cb.vercel.app/user to update user information. This is typically used to record the user's activity or log them in on the server-side.
If the server acknowledges the update, a success message is displayed using swal.
Navigation:

After a successful sign-in or Google sign-in, the user is redirected to the previous page they were on (if any), or the home page.
